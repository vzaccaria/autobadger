## Install

Install it with

```
npm install autobadger
```
## Usage

```
~USAGE~
```

## Prerequisite

Have a `makefile` with a `test` target ready; autobadger tries to build it and emits a badge link (markdown) depending on the outcome.

Ideally, you should have a pre-commit hook that invokes it and puts it into the readme file.
